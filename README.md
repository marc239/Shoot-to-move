# Shoot-to-move
Game made using assembly language for the CPCRetrodev 2020

Used cpctelera, a low-level library for Amstrad CPC. Check more here: https://github.com/lronaldo/cpctelera

I would not advise anyone to use this code as an example, I ended up having less time than I expected to make the game and that affected the quality of the code.
